On Tuesday evening, I gave a 20 slide 'lightning talk' at the <a href='http://lrug.org'>London Ruby Users Group (LRUG)</a> entitled "Ruby Poetry".  Inspired by <a href='http://twitter.com/hlame'>Murray Steele</a>'s "<a href='http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/my-first-ruby'>My First Ruby</a>" talk at a previous LRUG, I decided to tell a story about a small progam I wrote about five years ago, when I was fairly new to ruby.  At the time, I had just made the transition to ruby after years as Java developer, and I was amazed at how easy it was to solve problems without having to write very much code.

The story starts when I was invited to a party.  The party was a themed <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burns_supper'>Burns Night</a> dinner.  These celebrations are common in Scotland to celebrate the life and poetry of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Burns'>Robert Burns</a>.  I had been invited to the same party the previous year, and remembered back to enjoying the haggis and whisky.  One thing I remembered that had not felt particularly comfortable with, is that I had been asked to bring a poem to read.  On the evening, instead of brining poems, most people had written their own, and I felt bad for lacking creativity.  I decided that this time around, I would try to be creative in my own way, and write a ruby program to generate some topical poetry from the day's news headlines.  I won't go into too much detail here, as my five minute talk  was kindly videoed by <a href='http://skillsmatter.com'>Skills Matter</a>:

## The final code
The code below is what I used to generate the couplets on the day.  While I had been tuning my algorithm, I wrote the headlines to a file so I didn't have to reload them eachc time. The full source is <a href='https://github.com/andrewmcdonough/ruby-poetry'>on github</a>.

``` ruby generate_topical_rhyming_couplets
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'rss'

# Open the list of feeds
fh = open("feeds.txt")
feeds = fh.read.split "\n"

# For each feed, get the headlines
headlines = []
feeds.each do |feed|
  begin
    file = open(feed)
    rss = RSS::Parser.parse(file.read)
    feed_headlines = rss.items.map {|i| i.title}
    headlines += feed_headlines
  rescue
    puts "Error with #{feed}"
  end
end

# Remove duplicates and strip some prefixes
headlines = headlines.uniq!
headlines = headlines.map {|h| h.gsub /^(AUDIO|VIDEO): /,""}

# Test for couplets
def couplet?(a,b)
  as = a.gsub /\W/,"" # Ignore punctuation
  bs = b.gsub /\W/,""
  as[-3,3] == bs[-3,3] &&
    !(as[-5,5] == bs[-5,5]) &&
    (as.length - bs.length).abs < 10 &&
    (as.length > 30 && as.length < 70) &&
    (bs.length > 30 && bs.length < 70)
end

# Sort the headlines by the last three letters
headlines.sort! {|a,b|  a[-3,3] <=> b.reverse[-3,3] }

# Iterate over the headlines, testing in pairs for couplets
i = 0
while (i < headlines.length-2) do
  a = headlines[i]
  b = headlines[i+1]
  if couplet?(a,b)
    i += 1
    puts "#{a}\n#{b}\n\n"
  end
  i += 1
end

```

As the couplet finding algoritm was fairly crude, only looking for matches of the last three letters, and not the phonetic reprentation, I allowed myself to pick the best couplets as generated on the day.  To demonstrate my code, I reran the program on the day of my talk, and read the best couplets it generated at the end:

### The final poem, as generated on the day of the talk*
<div class='paper'>Eurozone agrees second Greek bail-out

Man released after Sunday arrest
South Sudan puts Beijing policies to the test

Young carers need more support

Are there more strikes on the way?
I love my ID card. Can they really be taking it away?

I particularly like the last one, which like the others, was genuinely generated on the day.

So the two talks I have given at LRUG have been entitled Ruby Poetry and <a href="rubygolf-presentation.heroku.com">Ruby Golf</a>.  What Ruby &lt;insert word here&gt; should I do next?
